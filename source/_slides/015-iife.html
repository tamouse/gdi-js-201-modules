<p>See this little thing on the end of our module?</p>
<pre>
  <code>
    ...}());
  </code>
</pre>
<ul>
  <li class="fragment">
    That's an IIFE, which stands for "Immediately-Invoked Function Expression"
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
    Since our module is implemented as a function, invoking it
    immediately defines the module, including all the inner function
    definitions
  </li>
  <li class="fragment">
    By returning the <code>vm</code> object we defined inside the
    module function, we gain access to all the methods and properties.
  </li>
</ul>
<aside class="notes">
  Remember that when we want to <em>call</em> a function, we add the
  parentheses pair after it's name. The IIFE calls the function we've
  just defined immediately after it's defined.
